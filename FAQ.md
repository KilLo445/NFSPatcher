# Frequently Asked Questions
1. Something broke! Help!
    - If you are having issues with anything, please join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EgBPkAC) or open an [issue](https://github.com/KilLo445/NFSPatcher/issues)!
2. Does this work with the disc versions of NFS?
    - Yes! It was actually made for and tested on the phyical discs! It should still work if you download them online though!
3. Where does the patcher download files?
    - The main patches for most games are official patches, but since they are no longer hosted officially on EA's servers, they are hosted [here](https://github.com/KilLo445/NFSPatcher/tree/main/Remote/PatchFiles) in the repo. For the community made patches, they are downloaded from the official source if possible, [ThirteenAG's WFP](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack), Zaps' [NFS II SE Wrapper](https://github.com/zaps166/NFSIISE/), etc. If the download fails it will resort to downloading my backup on the repo. (If you are a developer of one of these patches and don't like me hosting it on my repo, please send me a message!)
